# Building a Traffic Sign Recognition Classifier
### Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree

**Author:** Bryan Rosales
**Date:** July 7th, 2017


Overview
---

This is the second project of Udacity Self-Driving Car NanoDegree. The scope is to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network to predict traffic sign using the Germany Data set Traffic Signs. The network should have an accuracy greater than 93% when validating the test data set. Please see [Writeup](https://github.com/brosales8/traficc_sign_classifier/blob/master/Writeup.html) for more details of the project.
